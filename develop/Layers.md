# Create your first Layer

Follow the [ Yocto dev manual](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/latest/dev-manual/dev-manual.html#creating-your-own-layer) instructions.

The layer created was called *first*, therefore the folder meta-frist was created.
By the end you should have created the following structure inside the meta-first folder.

```console
joao@joao-ThinkPad-T470p:~/yocto/poky$ tree meta-first/
meta-first/
├── conf
│   └── layer.conf
├── COPYING.MIT
└──  README
```
